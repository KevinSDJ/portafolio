        <p>
        I discovered programming more than a year ago, as I always liked technology, I was instantly hooked, it was difficult, a real challenge for me, but I didn't give up because despite everything I liked it, I gave my best effort to learn how to work team up. I like to help, learn from others, I want to continue building things and be able to share it with others.
         </p>
      </Content>
      
    </GridLayout2>
  </Section>)
